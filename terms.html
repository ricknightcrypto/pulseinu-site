    Token Minting Terms
</div>

<p class="terms-content">
    This document serves as a disclaimer and terms for the act of minting the tokens. Before participating in the token
    minting process, please take the time to read and understand the following important points. "Tokens" mentioned
    below would be referring to $PulseInu on ETH mainnet and $PulseInu on PulseChain mainnet.
</p>

<p class="terms-subheader">
    No Public or Private Sale
</p>

<p class="terms-content">
    It is important to note that there is no public or private sale of the tokens ever. The tokens are mintable by those
    community members in recognition of their free speech via past on-chain activities. If you are not eligible to
    participate in the minting process, please do not attempt to do so.
</p>

<p class="terms-subheader">
    No Token Value
</p>

<p class="terms-content">
    Furthermore, it is important to note that the tokens have no inherent value. Token minting is not an investment
    opportunity. Instead, the minting process serves as a means to create a digital asset that can be used within a
    specific ecosystem. There should be no
    expectation of any economic return or other benefits by minting the tokens. Any further token price move and staking
    activities would be pure community & market activities.
</p>

<p class="terms-subheader">
    Restrictions on Participation
</p>

<p class="terms-content">
    Please note that United States citizens and OFAC-sanctioned citizens are not expected to participate in token
    minting. The laws and regulations surrounding digital assets in the United States are complex and constantly
    evolving. As such, we cannot guarantee the legality or compliance of minting this token for individuals residing
    within the United States. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are eligible to participate in the minting
    process. We have also conducted a crosschecking against OFAC sanction address list & some community maintained
    blacklist and
    have found none of our community addresses is included. We reserve the right to do this regularly on an ongoing
    basis.
</p>

<p class="terms-subheader">
    Decentralization
</p>

<p class="terms-content">
    The protocol and token contracts are fully decentralized on blockchain(s), and front-end pages are hosted on
    peer-to-peer IPFS network. The tokens supply are also exceedingly decentralized for both $PULSEINU and $PulseInu. No one
    is controlling protocol back-end, front-end or majority of any token supply. As a result, the community members who
    participate in the minting process bear the sole responsibility for the outcomes of their actions.
</p>

<p class="terms-subheader">
    PulseInu Team Responsibility
</p>

<p class="terms-content">
    The team will
    not be held liable for any issues that arise due to community members' actions. If you choose to participate in the
    minting process, you do so at your own risk.
    Thank you for taking the time to read this document. We highly recommend that all potential token minters seek legal
    counsel before participating in the minting process.
